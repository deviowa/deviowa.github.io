# A Version Controll System

## git

We are going to use **git**, a distributed source code / version management system.  It allows us to keep track of the code we write, when and how we made changes, and who made them.  By doing so, it keeps a history of every version we "*commit*" to our *"code repository"* (which is just the folder we save our project files in for most practicle purposes).

This sounds usefull by itself, but even if you're not that worried about undoing changes, or inspecting changes, there are two things that git will enable us to do that otherwise will quickly involve into chaos:

<br/>
- **branching**<br/>
Git lets us create project "branches", which let's us have and managing multiple seperate versions of our code at any given point in time without getting things unintentionally mixed up.

<br/>
- **collaboration**<br/>
We can each have our own repository and share changes or additiona we have made with others that have a copy of the repository. The way changes are tracked, let's git identify if there are conflicts in the changes made by two different people.  This let's us collaborate on software as a team without beong confused by and otherwise getting in each others way.


### Installing git
Make sure you have *homebre* installed, then just enter the following command in your terminal and be on your way:

```
brew install git
```

## Learning git
git can be akward getting used to if you've never used it before.  For an excellent intro checkout this [tutorial on github](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)


## github
Other than for the tutorial mentioned above, you should visit https://github.com/ itself and **create an account if you have not already**.  You can create as many open source repositpries as you want, and you will need an account to commit to shared repositories, comment on discussions, or edit project issue / bug tracker items, wiki pages, etc.  Most open source projects host their code on github.  Alot of them use github to manage those proejcts, collaborate with others.  In a way it's a social network for developers.
