## A Web Browser
I'm going to assume, that you have used a Web Browser before.  Web Browsers provide the platform of the World Wide Web.  Since we are going to be developing for the web, most of the the code we write is likely to be executed either directly inside/by the Browser program used to access the website, or on a server.  In the later case, the code executed on the server is likely to be generating/sending data meant to be used by the browser in one form or another.

Although `Safari` is Apple's default browser and is installed by default on OSX, we are going to install some other browsers as well.    For now, let's just install  [Google Chrome](www.google.com/chrome). Chrome become the most popular browser world wide in recent years, as you can see in the diagram below. It also has some very nice built in developer tools that will be incredibaly useful when we are developing web applications.

Unfortunaently, different browsers handle or implement certain features slightly different sometimes, so at some point, we may want to install some of the popular browsers (or even various versions of each), so that we can test our web sites for compatibility on each one.  And let's not forget about browser on mobile devices...
