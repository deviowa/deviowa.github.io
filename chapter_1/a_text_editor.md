# A Text Editor


A text editor is one of the most important tools for software development. I would liken any attempt to write code without a halfway decent text editor to sewing without a needle, driving a nail without a hammer, or performing surgery without a scalpel.


## Choice of Text Editor



I am not going to tell anyone they need to use a specific text editor; especially if you are already happily used to a particular editor.  If you don't have a lot of experience using a certain editor, I may suggest [sublime text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). *Sublime* is pretty popular amongst both novoice and experienced programmers.  It is a great text editor for programming and other developer.

To install sublime 3, you just have to download the dmg file linked on http://www.sublimetext.com/3.  Then just open the  download / dmg file (a dmg files is a Apple Disk Image...it's kind of like a glorified zip file).  The disk image has the OSX app in it, which you just need to drag your Applocations folder to install it permanently.

There are lots of plugins available that make working with a specific programming languages or other context much easier.  If you installed Sublime, head over to https://sublime.wbond.net/installation and follow the instructions to install *"Package Controll"*, a package manager for sublime plugins.

## Vim or Emacs
Vim and Emacs are text editors that are particularly popular amongst programmers.  Both of them are extremely customizable and powerful tools; that being said...they are a bit different.  I'm not sure about the best word to describe them...somethign along the lines of eccentric or arcane maybe.  They take a little longer to get used to, but once you get used to one of these, both are powerful tools that can chnage the way and efficientcy with which you edit sourcecode.

I personally use vim. I think I once used emacs about 10 years ago, and have stayed away from it with religious fervor since discovering vim around the same time.

Like I said, its a matter of taste and what works best for you, if you feel comfortable and efficient with emacs there is probably no need to try to get used to vim (this stuff is more about muscle memory than anything else I think.

At the end of the day, I don't think there is a silver bullet.  I know my fingers will cramp up unless I am using vim because they are so used to it.  The philosophy behind vim is that is very easy to customize.


> **warning** Being so customizable, also means it's tempting to spend a lot of time tweaking the configuration and playing around with customizing vim (a rabbit holes I have fallen into more than once).

**If your interested in vim:**<br/>

vim uses different **modes** (input/normal/visual/etc,).  This is probably the hardest thing to get used to because it's so different.  If you have not used it before definitely go through the **vim tutor** (if you install vim, it usually install a command line program called vimtutor...if you want to use vim...you want to go through this!)

some resource on configuring vim:
- spf13:  pretty good default configuration setup for coding: http://vim.spf13.com/

sorry, your on your own :P
