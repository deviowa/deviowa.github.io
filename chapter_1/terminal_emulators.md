# A Terminal Emulator

A Terminal Emulator is a GUI that allows us to interact with the **shell**.  If you have little or no experience using a command line interface, don't worry -- using it will quickly become second nature and make you appretiate the efficiency of typing instructions vs having to move a mouse cursor across the screen just to click one thing at a time.

OSX comes with a built in terminal application that we can use to access the Command Line Interface / shell.  The application is aptly named *Terminal*.  To start the terminal application, we could open **Finder** (The file system browser / explorer), navigate to the **Applications** folder, then find the **Utilities** folder inside of it, and finally double click **Terminal** to open a terminal window.  However, it's much easier to use **Spotlight** (a tool to search for things on your computer).

To start `Terminal` using Spotlight:
 1. Hold down the âŒ˜ (command) key and press `space` to start spotlight
 2. Start typing `Terminal`
 3. When the *Terminal* app is the *Top Hit*, press `enter` to start it

Once you have the Terminal window open, you should see the command line prompt.  You can enter commands to be executed by simply typing. Try for exmaple typing `ls` followed by the `enter` key.  You should see some output printed to the terminal window, followed by another prompt.  The output from the `ls` program is a list of files and directories in the current working directory.  To find out what directory you are currently in, you can type `pwd` (**p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory) and hit `enter`.

If you are not used to using a command line, it may seem odd to run programs this way at first.  And although the learning curve is a little steaper at first because the command line doesnt really offer you an intuitive way to discover new commands, once you understand and get used to a few basic concepts and conventions may even start prefering the command line over some GUI applications to perform routine tasks.

We will soon take a more detailed look at the shell.  For now, knowing how we can get to the command line and run a given command is all we need in order get started.
