# Setting up OSX for Web Development




As a [UNIX](unix) based operating system, OSX already contains a bunch of tools/programs that will be very useful for our web development purposes. However, before we get started writing code, it's probably a good idea to install a few additional tools that will improve our workflow and make our lives a lot easier.

The following is a list of tools so essential, that we will almost certianly be using them on a daily basis:
 - A Web Browser
 - A Terminal Emulator
 - A Text Editor
 - A Package Manager
 - A Version Control System
